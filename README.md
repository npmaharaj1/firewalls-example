<h1>Rationale</h1>
<p>- By definition a firewall is a "program" that sits in devices such as desktop and routers. Their main goal is to prevent malicious network activity by blocking certain IP Addresses as listed in their Allowlist or Blocklist. This project provides a <b>very simplistic</b> idea on how one works and give some context as to what an allow-list or block-list is.</p>

<h1>Disclamer</h1>
<p>This project is a bit rushed due to it's original purpose to be an assignment item for college :). Therefore, it wasn't created with efficiency in mind, it just needed to work.</p>
